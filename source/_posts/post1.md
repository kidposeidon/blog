title: "My First Blog: The Palo Alto Short Story Contest"
date: March 18, 2018

  I just started working on a short story for the Palo Alto Short Story
contest. I am updating the story on Wattpad under my editor, Wetflame. It's
a story about a girl, Delphine, who is sick with a disease called Fucosidosis
and her struggles as she tries to get better, find friends and undergo surgery.
We are currently still editing it but we hope to place in the the top three
in the contest. The maximum amount of words is 2,500 and it's due April 6th.
If you want the link to join the Short Story competition, it is at

near here, then hopefully you can try to join another contest in your area!
