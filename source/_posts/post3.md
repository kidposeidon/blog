  Over the weekend, I was invited to play for the 05G Blue team. (This stands
  for girls born in 2005 blue team, which is the best team). I'm currently an
  06, but I found that despite the difference between our ages it was an
  amazing experience! Our first game was against Hollister, which we won 1-0!
  I had a great time playing left/right winger and forward. I tried out new
  moves and discovered some new skills and had a great time playing! Our second
  game was against Elite, from Newark. I had another great game and enjoyed it
  greatly. We won 3-0. Our third game took place against Mount Diablo. I had
  an AMAZING game. I played left wing most of the time and did some great moves
  and tricks. The one that I was most proud of was a reverse meg pass. We tied
  the game 2-2, but we went on to the finals where we played them again. We won
  in a heated game, 2-1, and I enjoyed playing and had a great time. All the
  girls on the team were extremely welcoming and friendly, even though I was
  a guest player and had never met them before, and they were extremely fun
  and great to be around! I hope that I can play with them again!
