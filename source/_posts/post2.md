  Me, my father, and my sister are currently planning on going on a ski trip!
Our plan is that we are going to stay in Truckee over night and then go up
to the resort and ski. This is preparation for Utah, which is where we are
going for spring break to see our friends. Since our friends have been up
there for awhile and they already know how to ski very well, we are practicing
so we can ski with them. I've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and might
try and take lessons when we go to Utah.
