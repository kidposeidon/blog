It’s<br>a story about a girl, Delphine, who is sick with a disease called Fucosidosis<br>and her struggles as she tries to get better, find friends and undergo surgery.<br>We are currently still editing it but we hope to place in the the top three<br>in the contest. The maximum amount of words is 2,500 and it’s due April 6th.<br>If you want the link to join the Short Story competition, it is at<br><a href=\"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/short_story/entry.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.paloaltoonline.com/short_story/entry.php</a>.
