(This stands\n  for girls born in 2005 blue team, which is the best team). I'm currently an\n  06, but I found that despite the difference between our ages it was an\n  amazing experience! Our first game was against Hollister, which we won 1-0!\n  I had a great time playing left/right winger and forward. I tried out new\n  moves and discovered some new skills and had a great time playing! Our second\n  game was against Elite, from Newark. I had another great game and enjoyed it\n  greatly. We won 3-0. Our third game took place against Mount Diablo. I had\n  an AMAZING game. I played left wing most of the time and did some great moves\n  and tricks. The one that I was most proud of was a reverse meg pass. We tied\n  the game 2-2, but we went on to the finals where we played them again. We won\n  in a heated game, 2-1, and I enjoyed playing and had a great time.
